The Project
=====

### The project folder
`res://`  

### A Decent file structure
(picture diagram of mock file structure)  

### Bringing in graphics  


Where To Start?
=====
We begin by creating a Minimal Viable Product. We want to strip our game down to only what is essensial to make the game work
and still be considered "a game". For our roguelike, we only *really* need two important things: A world for the player to navigate, and a
player-controlled agent to navigate that world with.  

## The Map
Our first scene will be our game's Map. The Map scene will be the object representing the static world our game will exist in. In short, 
the dungeon's floors and walls.  

### Tilesets
Our TileMap will be of little use to us unless we have some way to paint tiles onto its cells. To do that, we need to create a tileset
resource.  

## The Player
Our Player object will be constructed as its own scene. We'll instance it as a child of our Map node.  

### The Icon
The `Node2D` has no visual elements, so we need to add some. Add a Sprite child named "Icon".
